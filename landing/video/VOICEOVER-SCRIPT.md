Building skills from scratch.

MCPs that break every update.

Forty percent of your context... gone.

There's a better way. Rising Tides.

A curated library of one hundred eighty production-ready skills. Thirty-seven pre-configured plugins. Seventeen MCP integrations. Nine CLI tools — fully documented. Everything you need to ship faster. Nothing you don't.

Just describe what you need.

Watch this in action. "Help me set up Stripe payments." Auto-matched: stripe-integration. CLI auth configured. Payments live in four commands. "Build a dashboard with React and shadcn." Auto-matched: react-dev, frontend-design. Live docs via Context7. Components installed. "Run an SEO audit." Auto-matched: seo-audit. Forty-seven checks, schema markup, Core Web Vitals — all covered.

Here's the magic. One hundred eighty skills available. Seven percent context cost. Not forty percent. Seven. Zero manual loading. Auto-discovery handles everything. More context for your actual work. Less wasted on skill overhead.

Getting started is easy. Mac, Linux, or Windows — one command. Prerequisites auto-detected. Claude Code installed. Skills configured. Done.
